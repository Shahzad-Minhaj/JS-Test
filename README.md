## Features

- Displays the time (hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds) of the mouse click.
- Shows the x and y coordinates of the mouse click position relative to the document.

## How it Works

- The script listens for mouse click events on the document.
- When a click event occurs, it retrieves the current date and time.
- It then logs the click event details (including clientX and clientY properties) and updates the HTML to display the time and position of the click.
